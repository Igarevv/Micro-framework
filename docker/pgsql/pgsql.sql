53	Harry Potter and he Philosopher's Stone	1997	It is a story about Harry Potter, an orphan brought up by his aunt and uncle because his parents were killed when he was a baby. Harry is unloved by his uncle and aunt but everything changes when he is invited to join Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and he finds out he's a wizard.\r\n                    	ed22e2e9-2f0b-4b6f-b0d6-a1b0e2dcc5a6	["fantasy","adventure"]	3234567891234
54	Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets	1998	Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a fantasy novel written by British author J. K. Rowling and the second novel in the Harry Potter series. The plot follows Harry's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, during which a series of messages on the walls of the school's corridors warn that the "Chamber of Secrets" has been opened and that the "heir of Slytherin" would kill all pupils who do not come from all-magical families. These threats are found after attacks that leave residents of the school petrified. Throughout the year, Harry and his friends Ron and Hermione investigate the attacks. The book was published in the United Kingdom on 2 July 1998 by Bloomsbury and later in the United States on 2 June 1999 by Scholastic Inc.\r\n                    	4a86ce3d-0ee1-4ff8-bb03-c3d5d2a2e2e1	["fantasy","adventure","documentary"]	234567891234
55	Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban	1997	Harry Potter & The Prisoner of Azkaban is about Harry’s 3rd year at Hogwarts. Along with friends Ron and Hermione, Harry investigates the case of Sirius Black, an escaped prisoner from Azkaban, the wizard prison. Sirius Black is believed to be one of Voldemort's allies, and he is the only wizard ever to escape Azkaban, so he is definitely powerful. Harry Potter then overhears that Sirius Black wants to kill him. This book is full of creeps and chills, like in one part, the train to Hogwarts is stopped because of terrible flying things that can suck out your soul. Because of these soul-suckers, Harry almost dies, but in the end, Harry learns a lot about himself, his parents, and friends (both of his, and his parents’). But this book is still full of interest. In a memorable moment, Harry Potter flies on a Hippogriff, which is a hybrid between a horse and eagle. In another part, The Prisoner of Azkaban goes from fantasy to sci-fi, because of time travel, where Harry goes back in time to save himself. With the adventurous and scary parts in perfect balance, this book is a good read, and personally, it is my favorite book in the whole series. 	5f1e759e-a9a9-4678-88e2-2a836573dd89	["drama","adventure","documentary"]	1234567891234
56	Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire	2000	Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a fantasy novel written by British author J. K. Rowling and the fourth novel in the Harry Potter series.

The book was published in the United Kingdom by Bloomsbury and in the United States by Scholastic. In both countries, the release date was 8 July 2000. This was the first time a book in the series was published in both countries at the same time. Over the summer, the Weasleys invite Harry Potter to attend the Quidditch World Cup final, played between Bulgaria and Ireland. The match ends in a victory for the Irish, but the campsite is attacked by Voldemort's former followers called the Death Eaters. Nobody is killed, but the Dark Mark is set off and is believed to have been cast by Barty Crouch's house-elf, Winky. \r\n                    	4dfe4f13-5252-4bb8-8262-87380d2b538b	["drama","fantasy"]	234567891434

The novel was published on 21 June 2003 by Bloomsbury in the United Kingdom, Scholastic in the United States, and Raincoast in Canada. It sold five million copies in the first 24 hours of publication.

One evening, Dementors attack him and cousin Dudley, but Harry fends them off using the Patronus Charm. 	b51396f3-b60f-4782-9c64-bcd55c35e3da	["fantasy","adventure"]	234547891834
58	Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince	2005	Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a fantasy novel written by British author J. K. Rowling and the sixth and penultimate novel in the Harry Potter series. Set during Harry Potter's sixth year at Hogwarts, the novel explores the past of the boy wizard's nemesis, Lord Voldemort, and Harry's preparations for the final battle against Voldemort alongside his headmaster and mentor Albus Dumbledore. The book was published in the United Kingdom by Bloomsbury and in the United States by Scholastic on 16 July 2005, as well as in several other countries. It sold almost seven million copies in the first 24 hours after its release,[1] a record eventually broken by its sequel, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. There were many controversies before and after it was published, including the right-to-read copies delivered before the release date in Canada. Reception to the novel was generally positive, and it won several awards and honours, including the 2006 British Book of the Year award. Reviewers noted that the book had a darker tone than its predecessors, though it did contain some humour. Some considered the main themes love, death, trust, and redemption. The considerable character development of Harry and many other teenage characters also drew attention. \r\n                    	24f55a90-f9a6-474e-ac74-b2d5d97336cf	["drama","fantasy","adventure"]	7234567891034
